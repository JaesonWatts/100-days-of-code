# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Basic React app created and react server working on frontend.  RoR backend created, cors configured, and rails s working properly and returning a json return in the browser. 

**Thoughts:** I decided to build this react app with a RoR backend so that I can implement authentication between a SPA frontend and RoR backend because I have not done so and want to learn this skill. Also I found react to be the most difficult part of the bootcamp and want to strengthen my react skills.

### Day 2: November 18, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: User model and session store set up, ability to register, log in, and log out has been implemented. I plan to fork this repo at this point and save it as a template for an api with authentication.  This authentication has been hand made, I did not use devise.

**Thoughts:** I've now set up several RoR APIs and it is starting to feel familiar. I did something similar in one of my flatiron projects so next time I WILL use devise in order to do something different. Tomorrow I will begin creating 2 components in the react app to give the user the ability to register log in and log out from the front end.
