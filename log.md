# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Basic React app created and react server working on frontend.  RoR backend created, cors configured, and rails s working properly and returning a json return in the browser. 

**Thoughts:** I decided to build this react app with a RoR backend so that I can implement authentication between a SPA frontend and RoR backend because I have not done so and want to learn this skill. Also I found react to be the most difficult part of the bootcamp and want to strengthen my react skills.

### Day 2: November 18, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: User model and session store set up, ability to register, log in, and log out has been implemented. I plan to fork this repo at this point and save it as a template for an api with authentication.  This authentication has been hand made, I did not use devise.

**Thoughts:** I've now set up several RoR APIs and it is starting to feel familiar. I did something similar in one of my flatiron projects so next time I WILL use devise in order to do something different. Tomorrow I will begin creating 2 components in the react app to give the user the ability to register log in and log out from the front end.

### Day 3: November 20, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Technically it's still Thursday because I haven't slept. React app work started. Home and dashboard components created, working on registration component. Having some trouble with axios giving me a return but it's 3 am and I am going to bed.

**Thoughts:** I dislike react solely because it was hard for me in school. and because of that I will keep doing react stuff until i no longer have troubles with it. I skipped thursday because single parenting remote learners in a pandemic is just effing stupid. after dealing with that all day I didnt even have the energy to sit at the pc so as a compromise I read from my Ruby book. 
I do know that waiting til the end of the day is probably going to be the wrong approach. I will have to get up an hour earlier in order to fit in this coding before the day of parenting starts. I need an income to pay for child care.

### Day 4: December 03, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the first phase of my market-pattern-analyzer. I have a hobby method for trading cryptocurrency that I decided to try to automate.

**Thoughts:** Mental health and physical health are fleeting. When either or both flee everything stops. It feels good to be well enough to code again. Now we are all sick with covid-19 symptoms after multiple direct exposures to a super spreader outbreak. I find refuge in coding during this.

### Day 5: December 04, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued work on my market pattern analyzer. I had the gold price history analyzer working and spent the time doing the same with the btc data.

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time just changing figures and rerunning code, then thinking, then researching, rinse and repeat. Although there was not a lot of original code created today there was a lot of time spent on learning, thinking, and planning on this project. I can see just how complex this is going to be but I can also see the benefits of making it work.

### Day 6: December 08, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I started a ruby on rails app for tracking job applications and the status of them as well as metrics. I got local signup and login working as well as omniauth google 3rd party authorizion.

**Thoughts:** I love ruby and rails. like a lot. the ruby language is so elegant and pleasure to work in and I have built several api only rails apps recently but only one full RoR app. It feels good. I enjoy it. I had an interview today that validated my decision to focus on ruby and rails as a niche. forward!
