# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Basic React app created and react server working on frontend.  RoR backend created, cors configured, and rails s working properly and returning a json return in the browser. 

**Thoughts:** I decided to build this react app with a RoR backend so that I can implement authentication between a SPA frontend and RoR backend because I have not done so and want to learn this skill. Also I found react to be the most difficult part of the bootcamp and want to strengthen my react skills.
